Goal: become the ultimate second brain. helps people 10x their learning. 

IMMEDIATE TO DO
1) add memory so the AI doesn't repeat what it recommended. 
2) increase speed of recommendation.
3) add ability to explain words/sentence/paragraphs. 
4) cool idea: it would be cool to take voice notes of each session. 

(GENERAL GUIDE) WHAT I NEED
1) stay up to date with all the research. 
key point 1: I'm still a beginner. 
    - Need explaination of relevnce and also first principles explaination of the tech. 
    - Need to read seminal papers/literature of the field, i.e Minsky, Von Neumann, Rosenblatt, etc for CS and ML, not just the current literature.
key point 2: I want to develop my range
    - I want to learn and explore ideas from different fields as well. 

2) take notes/develop my insights
key point: I need a place where I can interact with the reading.
    -I want to be able to take notes/ask questions of the text all natively in the platform. 
        - get definition of a word.
        - get explaination/reframe of a sentence or paragah. 
    -I want the platform to identify and fill in my knowledge gaps.
        - should present rabbit holes/first principles wanderings and implications and connections. 
    -I want to be challenged
        - the platform should identify my ideas and present counter arguments and ask questions to help me deepen my insights/widen the perspective from which I approach the problem.
    -I want to stand on the shoulder of giants
        - the platform should inform me wether an idea of mine is novel or not. 
        - if not novel, then it should share with me the thoughts/writings of those who have already explored this.

3) Minimal Effort
key point: all the above must be native to the platform and require minimal effort on my part both when using on the computer and on the phone. Eventually I want to be able to have the learning featuers available to me app/platform agnostic (aka it doesn't depend on me being on the website)
