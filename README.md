hard to keep up with research you care about, especially in AI and robotics. the field is progressing wayyyy too fast.

built and deployed this at https://chat-a5c05.web.app/ so with literally just 1 click, you can get relevant research published in the last month.

structured cleanly. relatively concise (lol). and explained simply (more or less).

built and deployed MVP version in ~1-2hours. pretty much 0 vibe coding except for fly deployment. 

LEARNINGS:
1) building projects is important. Just spam projects you'll get better and much faster. This woulda taken me ages, but now I know my tech stack, I know how to do everything/how to break down the problem and test first etc, so its quite fast.
2) Going forward, I need to find projects that utilize different tech stacks and get into more fields. I don't want to be pigeon holed into this. Also, I need to go deeper, don't want to just be able to churn out random code. Next thing I will tackle is probably browser use agent that scrapes any website I want it to and figuring out parallelization. 
3) everything is more mood based than you think. overcome it and you're well on your way to being a 10x eng. I didn't want to build at all today. was just planning to watch Netflix, gossip girls or smth LMAO. Instead, forced myself to build and got into it and churned this out.
